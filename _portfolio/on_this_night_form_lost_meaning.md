This ongoing project takes inspiration from the art of figure drawing, which involves sketching the human figure, often done live with a model who is either standing or sitting in a pose that fully emphasizes the figure. The process captures the essence of the human body’s musculature, texture, and postures. It’s a practice with an emphasis on learning the shape and movement of the human form through fast and often formless sketches.
