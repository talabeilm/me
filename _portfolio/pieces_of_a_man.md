"
I saw him go to pieces
I saw him go to pieces

He was always such a good man
He was always such a strong, strong man
"

This series is heavily inspired by the song "Pieces of a Man" by Gil Scott Heron. 

The series of photos show a man barely holding it together. He puts on a mask of joy to navigate the struggles of making a living.
